# Ancestree

This gem provides a class to model a family tree and query some information
about it. 

The Idea came from from an event in our company called Language Shootout. In a
Language Shootout every developper can present his favorite programming language 
and can show how it is used to solve a predefined task and explain why he/she thinks the
language is the 'best'.

It's intended to show the pure language without the use of libraries as well as
showing the typical style of the language.

The task description can be found in the task-description.txt file (in german)
and sample test data can be found in the people.data file.

A diffferent solution for the same Task can be found here: https://github.com/vschep/family-tree
